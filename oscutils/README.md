# oscutils

Utility package for working with tables output by MetaMorpheus and Proteome Discoverer in the `organoid_scp` project.

## Style guide

Functions should be annotated with type hints following the format outlined in [PEP 484](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/). Note that we use `|` as an abbreviation for `typing.Union`, hence this package requires Python 3.10 or higher.

Docstrings should follow the [`numpydoc` standard](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#docstring-standard).
