Data in `proteome_discoverer` generated with Proteome Discoverer 3.0. Data in `metamorpheus` generated with MetaMorpheus 1.0.2.

Initially the MetaMorpheus analysis was ran on 11 Apr 2023 and included the blank, QC, and excluded samples. However, in discussions with Michael Shortreed and Alex from the MetaMorpheus project, we realized this could mess up the peptide-level normalization that MetaMorpheus performs, so we re-ran the analysis on 8 May 2023 with only the samples we cared about.

Initially the Proteome Discoverer analysis was ran on 10 Apr 2023, but one input file, `Psuedo-bulk_Unhealthy_CH2_D18.raw`, was accidentally left out. The Proteome Discoverer analysis was re-ran on 9 Aug 2023, including that file.
