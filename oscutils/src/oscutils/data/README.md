Data in `proteome_discoverer` generated with Proteome Discoverer 3.0. Data in `metamorpheus` generated with MetaMorpheus 1.0.2.

Initially the MetaMorpheus data had been generated on 11 Apr 2023 and included the blank, QC, and excluded samples. However, in discussions with Michael Shortreed and Alex from the MetaMorpheus project, we realized this could mess up the peptide-level normalization that MetaMorpheus performs, so we re-ran the analysis on 8 May 2023 with only the samples we cared about. That is the version now in this folder.
